<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Niloy. I born in a little villege in Dinajpur, Bangladesh's country side area. I'm a practicing muslim who is rational, loves to raise question in my mind, and then look for the answer, strongly believes that holy Quran is word of god as it doesn't have any scientic errors. It talked about scientific facts 1400 hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Muhammad(pbuh) didn't know how to read or write. His companions and enemies observed him very closely and know him from his very childhood. He predicted stuffs by the help of God whic became true and becoming true and will become true. He performed miraclaous events like Moses(pbuh), Jesus Christ (pbuh). He splitted the moon into two parts and joined together. There's a crack in the moon, you can get to know from the scientists.</p>

<p>I was an agnostic person then I found the truth, after doing some research on religions. I can prove you that God exists and he's most powerful. </p>
